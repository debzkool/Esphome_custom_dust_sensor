# Esphome_custom_dust_sensor

Simple code for Esphome custom dust sensor using Sharp air quality sensor.

Info:
Output values did not measured with any professional air quality sensor.
To calibrate values, i did find in internet air quality data from sensors around.
So i placed sensor near open window and compared data from sensor with outside sensors.

Good luck
